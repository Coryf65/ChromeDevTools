### More Info

Following along with a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/web-portfolio-projects-api-based-chrome-developer-tool) course!

### My Goal

I want to learn how Chrome Dev tools are made and an example of one.


## Notes

- Using 2 APIs

    1. [Chrome API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index)

        - [Runtime](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime)
        - [Storage](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage)

    2. [GitKraken Glo API](https://gloapi.gitkraken.com/v1/docs/)

- connecting to an app [GitKraken](https://app.gitkraken.com)

- The Manifest Starts our Chrome Extension

- The Panel is what displays inside our new Inspector Tool
